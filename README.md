# Tank Level Sensor Project
## Why?
We use a highly concentrated form of chlorine called AWSB-7000 that is constantly pumped into the water system to treat bacteria growth. It needs to be refilled by a contacted chemical company prior to being depleted, and the way to measure the tank was with a wooden stick. This required an operator to open the tank lid, exposing their eyes and lungs to the highly concentrated chemical, then dipping the wooden stick into the tank to see how many inches of liquid were in the tank.
